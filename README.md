## __1. Overview:__
This project focuses on using Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to optimize energy consumption in smart buildings. By leveraging historical energy usage data, the model predicts future consumption patterns and identifies anomalies to improve energy efficiency and reduce operational costs.

The study aims to:

- Develop an ELM-based predictive model for energy consumption forecasting.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE, MAE, RMSE, RÂ² score, and Accuracy.
- Provide insights that assist in HVAC optimization, demand-side management, and anomaly detection.
## __2. Implemented Algorithm: Extreme Learning Machines (ELM):__
Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) are fast, efficient neural networks that train in a single step without iterative updates. They are particularly useful in smart building energy management because:

- Fast Training: ELMs compute output weights using a closed-form solution, making training extremely fast.
- Non-Iterative Learning: Eliminates the need for backpropagation, reducing computational overhead.
- Good Generalization: Can effectively model energy consumption patterns with minimal tuning.
- Handles Large Datasets: Efficient for high-dimensional data generated by smart building IoT systems.
### Model Characteristics:
- Random Weight Initialization: Input weights are assigned randomly and fixed.
- Hidden Layer Activation: Uses Sigmoid, ReLU, or Tanh to capture energy usage trends.
- Analytical Solution: Solves a linear system instead of using iterative optimization.
## __3. Dataset Used:__
The dataset consists of 3,840 records of energy consumption data, including:

- Time-based variables (hour, day, season).
- Environmental factors (temperature, humidity).
- Building-specific data (occupancy, HVAC usage).
